# PhD Oral Examination Slides

These are the slides from my PhD oral exam, which was held on November 18,
2025. 

The examination was chaired by Mykel Kochenderfer and the committee members
were Stephen Boyd, Mert Pilanci, Balaji Prabhakar, Aaron Sidford, and Robert
Tibshirani. 

There are many bonus slides, almost none of which were used in the exam itself.
However, you may find them useful as they illustrate key points from many of my
papers.
